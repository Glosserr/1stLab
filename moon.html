      Please create a description of the Moon for a website describing the moon and the earth, 
      how the compare and contrast, their relationship together, 
      for all ages, somewhat scientific but still readable for most. 
      Limit this to 4-5 sentences of medium length.-->
    <p>The Moon, Earth's celestial companion, orbits our planet at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers. 
    Unlike Earth, the Moon lacks an atmosphere and liquid water, making its surface rugged and cratered from eons of meteoroid impacts. 
    Despite these differences, the Moon and Earth share a gravitational bond that causes tidal effects and stabilizes Earth's axial tilt, crucial for maintaining stable seasons and climate. 
    That which continues to keep inspiring exploration beyond our home planet.</p>
